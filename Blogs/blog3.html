    <p>Chicken lollipop is usually prepared using the middle segment of the chicken wing or thigh. The middle segment has one of the two bones removed, and the flesh on the segments is pushed to one end of the bone. These are then coated in a spicy red batter whose main ingredients include red chili powder, and turmeric.[2] The coated chicken is then marinated for a couple of hours.
